# INTRODUCTION
The dataset that I chose is called "2025 Ballon dO'r Full Player Stats Data Set" and it can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzammanafzadeh/2025-ballon-dor-full-player-stats-data-set?resource=download. This dataset gives us the total season statistics for 35 football players that might be nominated for the Ballon dâ€™Or 2025. The stats were collected by the author only from the matches that happened during the Ballon d'Or eligibility period, which is from August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025.

I firstly upload the dataset into the Rmd document to start exploring it.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
url<- ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arutam-antunish/DATA607/refs/heads/main/Player_Stats_All_Competitions.csv")
ballond_2025 <- read.csv(url)
glimpse(ballond_2025)
summary(ballond_2025)
```

Then I selected only the variables that I was gonna analyze on this assignment, then I also filtered the names of the players so I only had the strikers since I wanted to explore the goals and assists stats. I also changed the names of the players to have only their last names. 

```{r}
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% select(Player, Positions, Minutes.played, Goals, Assists, xG, xA)
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% filter(str_detect(Positions, "AMF|CF|CR|RW|LW|RWF|LWF"))
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% mutate(Player = word(Player, -1))
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% rename(Exp_Goals=xG, Exp_Assists=xA)
```

What I did with that information was to create the average of goals scored per match by each player. Then, I used a stacked bar chat to visualize who is the player with better statistics in this area. 

```{r}
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% mutate(Matches= Minutes.played/90)
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% mutate(Goals_match= Goals/Matches)
ballond_2025 %>%
 arrange(desc(Goals_match))
ballond_2025$highlight <- ifelse(ballond_2025$Player == "Kane", "Kane", "Others")
ggplot(ballond_2025, aes(x=Goals_match, y=reorder(Player, +Goals_match), fill = highlight)) + geom_col() + scale_fill_manual(values = c("Kane" = "darkblue", "Others" = "gray")) + labs(title = "Goals average per match", x = "Goals per matches played", y = "Player")
```

Here I replicated the analyze but instead of using goals, I found the average of assists made per match and after it I used a plot to found who was the player with the best statistic in the season regarding assists. 

```{r}
ballond_2025 <- ballond_2025 %>% mutate(Assists_match= Assists/Matches)

ballond_2025$highlight <- ifelse(ballond_2025$Player == "Salah", "Salah", "Others")
ggplot(ballond_2025, aes(x=Assists_match, y=reorder(Player, +Assists_match), fill = highlight)) + geom_col() + scale_fill_manual(values = c("Salah" = "darkgreen", "Others" = "gray")) + labs(title = "Assists average per match", x = "Assists per matches played", y = "Player")
```

# CONCLUSIONS
The analysis that I made here was superficial and short. I chose to only use a couple of players since I was going to use the goals and assists statistics. It means that we can not analyze the performance of a goalkeeper or defender based on how many goals they scored. Therefore, to make a better analysis and prediction we should firstly find a way to analyze the performance of each player depending on their position, and then make a comparison with others players performance to see who deserves this trophy based on the statistics.
